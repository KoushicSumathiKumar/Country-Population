# Country Population using REST COUNTRIES API

A simple command line interface program using JavaScript and Node.js that accesses the [REST API](https://restcountries.com). The program allow users to select a country and retrieve its population. The user is able to select a continent and then be presented with a list of countries from that continent which they can selected. I have used **jest** to demonstrate your understanding of unit testing and have implemented 7 tests to ensure all 3 of my methods function correctly.

## Set Up

If you'd like to run the JavaScript project provided, please ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official Node.js website: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

**Terminal commands:**
- make sure to cd to `rest-countries-cli`
- here are the installations I used, but if you already have then installed, do ignore them:
    ```
    npm install
    npm install dotenv
    npm install axios
    npm install jest --save-dev
    npm install readline-sync
    ```
- do make sure `test: jest` in your JSON.
- to run the main program: `node index.js`
- to run the test: `npm test`
